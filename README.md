# TensorFlow Learning

This project documents my journey in learning and using TensorFlow, a widely used machine learning and deep learning library.
Goal

The goal of this project is to understand the fundamentals of TensorFlow, learn how to build, train, and deploy machine learning models. This README will follow the key steps of this learning process.
Project Contents

Introduction to TensorFlow: Understand what TensorFlow is, how to install it, and its key features.
Building Models: Create simple models, such as neural networks, from scratch using Keras and TensorFlow.
Training Models: Learn how to train a model with real data, adjusting hyperparameters and using techniques like cross-validation.
Model Evaluation: Learn how to evaluate model performance on test data.
Making Predictions: Use the model to make predictions on new data.
Saving and Loading Models: Save and load trained models for reuse.
Installation

To install TensorFlow, use the following command:
pip install tensorflow
